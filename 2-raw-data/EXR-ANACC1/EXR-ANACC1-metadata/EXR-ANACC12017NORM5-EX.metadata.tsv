Experiment	EXR-ANACC12017NORM5-EX
- Experiment Type	smRNA-Seq
-- smRNA-Seq	
--- Amplified	Yes
---- DNA Quantification Method	Bioanalyzer
--- Library Generation	Library preparation was performed with the NEBNext Multiplex Small RNA Library Prep Set for Illumina (New England BioLabs Inc., USA). For each library, 6 Î¼L of RNA (min 35 ng) were used in all the experimental procedures as starting material. Each library was prepared with a unique indexed primer so that the libraries could all be pooled into one sequencing lane. Multiplex adaptor ligations, reverse transcription primer hybridization, reverse transcription reaction and PCR amplification were performed according to the protocol for library preparation (Protocol E7330, New England BioLabs Inc., USA). After PCR amplification, the cDNA constructs were purified with the QIAQuick PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen, Germany) following the modifications suggested by the NEBNext Multiplex Small RNA Library Prep Protocol and loaded on the Bioanalyzer 2100 (Agilent, Germany) using the DNA High Sensitivity Kit (Agilent, Germany) according to the manufacturerâ€™s protocol. Libraries were pooled together (24plex) and further purified with a gel size selection.

- exRNA Source Isolation Protocol	
-- Biofluid	
--- Cell Removal Step Done	No
-- Protocol Description	Samples from a hospital-based study for colorectal cancer diagnosis, subjects resulting negative to colonoscopy and to any inflammatory disease were included in the present study. Naturally evacuated stool samples were collected in special tubes with RNA stabilizing solution, returned at the time of performing colonoscopy and stored at ?80?C until RNA extraction. RNA from stool was extracted using the Stool Total RNA Purification Kit (Norgen Biotek Corp).
