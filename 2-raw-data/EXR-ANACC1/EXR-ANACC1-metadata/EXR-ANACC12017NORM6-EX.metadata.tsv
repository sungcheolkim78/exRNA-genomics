Experiment	EXR-ANACC12017NORM6-EX
- Experiment Type	smRNA-Seq
-- smRNA-Seq	
--- Amplified	Yes
---- DNA Quantification Method	Bioanalyzer
--- Library Generation	Library preparation was performed with the NEBNext Multiplex Small RNA Library Prep Set for Illumina (New England BioLabs Inc., USA). For each library, 6 Î¼L of RNA (min 35 ng) were used in all the experimental procedures as starting material. Each library was prepared with a unique indexed primer so that the libraries could all be pooled into one sequencing lane. Multiplex adaptor ligations, reverse transcription primer hybridization, reverse transcription reaction and PCR amplification were performed according to the protocol for library preparation (Protocol E7330, New England BioLabs Inc., USA). After PCR amplification, the cDNA constructs were purified with the QIAQuick PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen, Germany) following the modifications suggested by the NEBNext Multiplex Small RNA Library Prep Protocol and loaded on the Bioanalyzer 2100 (Agilent, Germany) using the DNA High Sensitivity Kit (Agilent, Germany) according to the manufacturerâ€™s protocol. Libraries were pooled together (24plex) and further purified with a gel size selection.

---- Other Kits	Urine microRNA Purification kit (Norgen Biotek Corp)
--- Description	Total RNA was extracted from urine supernatant samples using the Urine microRNA Purification kit (Norgen Biotek, Canada), according to the manufacturer's standard protocol.
-- Pre-purification of Extracellular Vesicles	No
-- Protocol Description	Urine samples from each participant were collected in the morning, stored at 4Â°C until the processing consisting of centrifugation at 3,000g for 10 min. The urine supernatant aliquots were then transferred in tubes and stored at â€“80Â°C until use.
- exRNA Source Isolation Protocol	
-- Biofluid	
--- Cell Removal Step Done	No
-- Protocol Description	Samples from a study population including men recruited between the years 2008-2012 in the Turin Bladder Cancer Study (TBCS) who donated an aliquot of blood and urine. Urine samples from each participant were collected in the morning, stored at 4Â°C until the processing consisting of centrifugation at 3,000g for 10 min. The urine supernatant aliquots were then transferred in tubes and stored at -80Â°C until use.
